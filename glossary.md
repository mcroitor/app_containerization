# Glossary

- _Docker_ - software for deploying applications in containers. It allows you to "package" an application with all its environment and dependencies into a container, which can be moved to any Linux system with `cgroups` support in the kernel, and also provides an environment for managing containers.
- _Kubernetes_ - software for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It allows you to manage the work of containers in a cluster.
- _Serverless computing_ - a cloud computing model in which a cloud provider automatically manages the allocation of machine resources.
- _Virtualization_ - technology that allows you to run an instance of an operating system within another operating system (called the _host_).
- _Virtual machine_ - a software implementation of a computer that runs programs like a physical machine.
- _Infrastructure_ - the physical or virtual resources that are used to support the operation of a system.
- _Cluster_ - a group of computers combined to perform a common set of tasks. Clusters are used to simplify scaling and increase fault tolerance. Also, talk about a _container cluster_ when a group of containers work together.
- _Containerization_ - a method of virtualization that uses the resources of the operating system kernel, as opposed to traditional virtualization, which involves hardware emulation.
- _Container_ - an instance of an image; a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
- _Scalability_ - the ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work or its potential to accommodate growth.
- _Reliability_ - the ability of a system to maintain its functionality under different conditions.
- _Image_ - a file that contains everything needed to run an application. It includes the application itself, dynamic libraries needed to run the application, configuration files, data.
- _Cloud_ - a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data in place of local servers or personal computers.
- _Cloud architecture_ - the design of systems that use cloud computing technologies.
- _Cloud computing_ - the delivery of IT resources (computing services, storage, and databases) by a cloud services provider to a client over the Internet on a pay-as-you-go basis.
- _Container orchestration_ - managing containers in a cluster.
- _Pod_ - an abstract object in Kubernetes representing a group of containers (or one) that share resources (such as data storage or an IP address). A Pod represents a specific application "logical host" and can contain different application containers that are generally closely related. It is an indivisible unit.
- _Portability_ - the property of software that allows it to be moved from one environment to another.
- _Server_ - a specialized computer and/or program that provides services to other programs (clients).
- _Service_ - a program that provides narrowly specialized services to other programs (clients).
- _Tag_ - a text label assigned to a Docker image that identifies the image version.
- _Node_ - a working machine in Kubernetes that runs pods.
- _Host_ - a computer (or operating system) that provides resources for virtual machines or containers.
- _Daemon_ - a program that runs in the background and performs various tasks.
- _Monolithic architecture_ - an architecture of an application in which all the code of the application is in one component.
- _Multicomponent architecture_ - an architecture of an application in which the application consists of several components.
- _Web service_ - a service that is available on the Internet.
- _Scaling_ - the ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources.
- _Orchestration_ - the automated configuration, coordination, and management of computer systems and software.
- _Repository_ - a storage of some files, in the context of containerization, these storages contain images.
